 If you dont like the engine that comes in this package, you can  make another engine that can "talk" with webchess.
 
 You need to know:

 There are 3 important files that the engine uses:


 boardIn.txt - This is the input. and play.php will generate it at each move like this:
 041b3b41R...K..RP.PP.PBP.P..P.P...........p...pQb.n..B..p.pp.p..r...k...

 04 is the PLY passed to the engine. So, you can use a easy player or a hard player. You can pass another value like: 08

 1b3b41
 ^    ^
 These numbers are the computer player: With 1 computer plays with black. 0 computer plays with white.
 b3b4 - This is the last move. Some engines need to know the human move to think your own move.


 Upper case characteres are White and lower case are black.
 Dots are empty positions.


 boardOut.txt - THis is the output. The boardIn whit the move.

....r.k.
p.pp...p
N.p..n..
.....pQ.
...P....
......PP
PPP.PP..
RN...RK.

 move.txt - this file will contain only the move. Like: d2g5





 initBoard.txt - This file is useles to the engine. But is used by engine.php to read the initial state of the board. This file looks like this:
 @move0RNBQKBNRPPPPPPPP................................pppppppprnbqkbnr
